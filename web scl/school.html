            <p class="scip reveal">Some of the topics in science are understood when practicals are done so it is important
                to have a science laboratory in school.It is the place where various kinds of practical works are
                carried out by the students. Without proper and well- equipped science laboratory, it is
                not possible to carry out the science teaching process effectively in any school or educational
                institution.
                Students learn to handle various apparatus and to think.
